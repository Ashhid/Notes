State law of conservation of angular momentum.
	- If no external torque is acting on the body is equal to zero, then the angular momentum will become constant.
	- Which can be proved by:$$\tau = 0$$$$\tau = \frac{dL}{dt}$$
 if $\tau = 0$ then $\tau = \frac{dL}{dt} = 0$ which means $L = constant$, since a differentiation of a constant leads to 0.

2. Newton's 2nd law of Rotational motion
	- When an external torque is acting to an object, the torque produces an angular acceleration.
	- Which is directly proportional to the torque and inversely proportional to the Moment of inertia.
$$\alpha \propto \frac{\tau}{I}$$

3. What is moment of Force?
	- The moment of force about a point is defined as the product of the magnitude of the force and perpendicular distance from the point to the line of action of force
---
4. What is Torque?
	- Torque is defined as the moment of force acting on a body in rotational motion with respect to the fixed point.
	$$\tau = F \times r $$

5. What is a Couple?
	- A couple constitutes a pair of two equal and opposite forces acting on a body in such away that the lines of action of the two forces are not in the same straight line.
---
6. What meant by moment of inertia?
	- Moment of inertia of a body is defined as summation of the product of the mass and the square of the perpendicular distance. of different particles the body from the axis of rotation
$$I = mr^2$$

7. Define CM (Center of mass)
	- When the entire mass of the body is concentrated in a particular point that point is called as the Center of mass.
---
8. Define Parallel axis Theorem:
	- It states that the moment of inertia with respect to any axis is equal to the sum of moment of inertia with respect to the parallel axis passing through the center of the mass and the product of mass and square of the perpendicular distance between the parallel axes
$$I_{AA\prime} = I_{XX\prime} + Mx^2$$
---
9. Define Perpendicular Axis Theorem:
	- It states the moment of inertia with respect to an axis perpendicular to the thin plane surface is equal to the sum of the moment of inertia of the respective perpendicular axis
$$I_{XX\prime} = I_{YY\prime} + I_{ZZ\prime}$$
---
10. State newton's first law of angular motion:
	- The state of rest or angular motion of an object will not change until there is no external torque is not acting not on it.
