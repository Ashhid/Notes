- The process of removing all types of impurities from water for domestically and industrial purpose is known as water treatment
- There are three types of contamination of water they are: 
	1. Physical
	2. Chemical
	3. Biological
---
1. Physical :
	- Suspended particles
	- Colloidal particles
	- Ex: The mixture of chalk and water, muddy water etc.
---
2. Chemical: 
	- dissolved gases
		- $CO_2$ in water
	- dissolved Salt
		- Hard water - $Mg$, $Ca$ in water 
		- Can be distinguished by soap water test.
---
3. Biological:
	- Virus
	- Fungus
	- Bacteria
-----
#### Hardness of Water
- There are two types of hardness of water they are Permanent hardness and temporary hardness
---
1. Temporary Hardness:
	- If carbonates and bicarbonate are present then temporary hardness
	- Ex: $CaCO_3$ & $Ca(HCO_3)_2$ 
	- Can be fixed by boiling
	- Adding lime to it
---
2. Permanent Hardness:
	- If it contains chlorides or sulphates then it's a permanent hardness
	- Ex: $MgCl_2$, $MgSO_4$, $CaCl_2$, $CaSO_4$
	- Can be removed by Zeolite
	- By Adding Soda Lime ($Na_2CO_3$).
