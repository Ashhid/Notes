- The process of removing all types of impurities from water for domestically and industrial purpose is known as water treatment
- There are three types of contamination of water they are: 
	1. Physical
	2. Chemical
	3. Biological
---
1. Physical :
	- Suspended particles
		- muddy water etc. no physical characteristics 
	- Colloidal particles
		- The mixture of chalk and water physical characteristics. 
---
2. Chemical: 
	- dissolved gases
		- Gas like $O_2$ $CO_2$ makes the water acidic. And accelerates the rate of corrosion.
		- $CO_2$ in water
			- CO2 + h20 = h2CO3(carbonic acid) 
	- dissolved Salt
		- Hard water - $Mg$, $Ca$ in water 
		- Can be distinguished by soap water test.
		- And EBT, turns into wine red.

3. Biological:
	- Virus
	- Fungus
	- Bacteria
		- These can cause diseases.
	- Other Microorganisms

#### Hardness of Water
- There are two types of hardness of water they are Permanent hardness and temporary hardness
---
1. Temporary Hardness:
	- If carbonates and bicarbonate are present then temporary hardness
	- Ex: $CaCO_3$ & $Ca(HCO_3)_2$ $MgCO_3$ & $Mg(HCO_3)_2$ 
	- Can be fixed by boiling
	- Adding lime to it (Ca(OH)2)
---
2. Permanent Hardness:
	- If it contains chlorides or sulphates then it's a permanent hardness
	- Ex: $MgCl_2$, $MgSO_4$, $CaCl_2$, $CaSO_4$.
	- Can be removed by Zeolite
	- By Adding Soda Lime ($Na_2CO_3$).

Brackish:
- The Salt water is called the brackish water.

Desalination:
- The process of removal of the common salt from the salt water is called Desalination.
- One of the best example for desalination is RO (Reverse Osmosis).
- Osmosis the process of the the movement of the solvent of the lower concentration to higher concentration is called Osmosis, through a SPM (Semi Permeable Membrane).
	- The pressure required for osmosis to happen is called Osmotic pressure ($\Pi$)
	- The name "Reverse osmosis" is more self explanatory.
		- It's the process of movement of the solvent from higher concentration to lower concentration by applying a hydrostatic pressure more than Osmotic pressure ($\Pi < P_{\text{ext}}$)
	- When this is performed the salt from the salt water is separated. And the solvent is transferred to the fresh water.

There are 3 types of water:
1. Fresh Water
2. Brackish Water
3. Sea Water
-  These are classified in the terms of salt content in the water
- In the fresh water the salt content is very low $\approx$ 1000PPM (Parts Per Million). 
- In Brackish water the salt content is more than 1000PPM and less than and more than 35000PPM.
- In Sea water the salt content is more than 35000PPM.
